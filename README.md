## About
Arithmeclick is a project I made for school so that when I or my classmates finish all their
work, we can do something, or sometimes my math teacher lets us just do it for class.
### History
---
It was a boring day at about 2:00 PM, and I finished all my work. I opened up Cookie Clickers,
because that is the 2nd-and-a-half best game of all time. I was clicking away, buying stuff, and
having a good time, but what I didn't reilize was that my math teacher was on the premises, watching
me. I relilzed a second too late. "What's that?" he asked. I explained that I was done all my work,
and I was bored, but no matter what, I could not convince him to let us play that game.

Weeks past.

Still no Cookie Clicker aloud.

I thought about it for a long time. Like half an hour. Then it came to me. I would create a math version
of Cookie Clicker. I worked for weeks on it. Finally, I finished the virst version. When I showed it too
my teacher, he loved it. But I still needed a name. The next day he came too me and suggested one. "Arithmeclick."

And that is how it all began.
